I’m not starting this blog at the beginning of the book. Maybe I should have, but let’s not pretend I know what I'm doing. Chapter Thirty-Two is a good place to start considering the themes found in the book. 
Margaret Mitchell wrote that Gone With the Wind was about survival and gumption, but I would argue pride and entitlement play a few hands throughout the story as well. Scarlett O'Hara is the embodiment of 
Southern affluence, but her roots are still quite fresh: she is the eldest daughter of a plantation owner, Gerald, who won his land in a card game and married a woman half his age before his luck could run out 
(Chapter 3). And let's not forget: this story is set against the backdrop of slavery—if that doesn't scream entitlement, I'm not sure what does.
</p>

<p>
From chapter Thirty-Two onward, I do plan to reflect on every chapter. But first, some commentary to set us up.
I’ll bounce around a bit—maybe pulling in a few earlier chapters to explore—but I won’t cover the book linearly.
</p>

<p>
Now let's meet the four big shots driving this Southern drama:

<ul>
  <li>
Scarlett O'Hara:
	Scarlett O'Hara marries three times in the novel and gives birth to three children (with three baby daddies).
	Spends most of the book claiming to love Ashley Wilkes. She is also the protagonist in the story—and an opportunist.
	Scarlett is 16 at the beginning of the novel and 28 when it finishes.
 </li>

<li>
Melanie Wilkes:
	Scarlett's #1 fan: both wife and cousin to Ashley Wilkes. She is often dismissed as naive or a dimwit; others 
	defend her as the elegant strategist. Melanie is two years older than Scarlett.
 </li>

 
<li>
Rhett Butler:
	Scam artist. His line at the end of the book is, "My dear, I don’t give a damn”—``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn", as 
	the movie portrays. Another opportunist. Rhett is about thirty-five when he is introduced in the novel and forty-seven at the end.
</li>

<li>
Ashley Wilkes:
	The dreamer; married to Melanie Wilkes. Ashley is in his early thirties at the start of the book and in his forties by the end.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There are several other characters in the novel that drive the survival, gumption, and superiority themes. We will
cover most of them shortly. However, let's get some rules out of the way with respect to this blog—rules that you can expect me
to follow:

1. The blog will be in reverse chronological order - older posts will appear lower down in the feed.

2. I will not go back and edit old posts - even for spelling: my mistakes will be forever immortalized—is that art or self-torture?

3. I will make a new, "modified" post if and when I feel that an earlier post no longer accurately reflects how characters and the storyline interact.

4. Lastly, I will update the blog weekly, starting today (07/31/2025).

<p>
So why chapter 32? Before we get into all that drama, let's take a look at Scarlett's parents: Gerald and Ellen. Gerald was 43 when he met 15-year-old 
Ellen through her father in Savannah. By then, he’d already secured a plantation, stocked with everything a lady might expect a gentleman 
to offer before proposing. He was also an Irishman in exile—having fled his homeland after a fatal dispute. Why? Because someone insulted him.
So Gerald did what any emotionally fragile man of the 1800s <em>might</em> do: he killed him. According to Gerald, the insult touched a matter of ancestral 
pride that spanned generations. And his family? They agreed. So Gerald hopped a boat to America, where two of his older brothers had already settled.
</p>
<p>
Gerald was just 21 when he arrived—young, loud, and full of gumption. Over time, he earned the respect of his neighbors. Mrs. Wilkes—perhaps a throwback to 
Ashley's mother, described in the book as "a great lady with a rare gift for silence"—makes only one appearance in the novel, just before Gerald's marriage, 
to note, "He has a rough tongue, but he is a gentleman." Translation: they’ll tolerate him, but he’s not one of them. Gerald isn’t part of the inner circle 
and his membership card comes with restrictions—namely, he can’t expect to marry any of his neighbors’ daughters. So he does what any determined outsider looking 
to upgrade his station would do: he heads to Savannah with his enslaved servant, Pork, to find a wife. He snags Ellen Robillard, a prim 15-year-old belle.
</p>

<p>
Ellen Robillard is most definitely a lady. She comes from a multi-generational Southern family with French ancestry.
She had been in love with her cousin, Phillipe, but when word came that he’d been killed in a ballroom brawl, she blamed 
her family—and vowed never to see them again. In other words, she kicked rocks - her version of flipping everyone off on the way out. 
The book describes it very delicately: <em>only Ellen and her mammy ever knew the whole story of the night when the girl sobbed till the dawn like a broken-hearted child and rose up in the morning a woman with her mind made up.</em>
</p>

<p>
And just like that, Ellen traded the world of debutante balls and French etiquette for a short, red-faced Irishman and rural Georgia: a man and countryside she did not know—it was either that or the convent.
Gerald had the land and the status. She had the name and the reputation. They had three daughters together, the first being Katie Scarlett O'Hara.
