I’m not starting this blog at the beginning of the book. Maybe I should have, but let’s not pretend I know what I'm doing. Chapter Thirty-Two is a good place to start considering the themes found in the book. 
Margaret Mitchell wrote that Gone With the Wind was about survival and gumption, but I would argue pride and entitlement play a few hands throughout the story as well. Scarlett O'Hara is the embodiment of 
Southern affluence, but her roots are still quite fresh: she is the eldest daughter of a plantation owner, Gerald, who won his land in a card game and married a woman half his age before his luck could run out 
(Chapter 3). And let's not forget: this story is set against the backdrop of slavery -- if that doesn't scream entitlement, I'm not sure what does.

From chapter Thirty-Two onward, I do plan to reflect on every chapter. But first, some commentary to set us up.
I’ll bounce around a bit—maybe pulling in a few earlier chapters to explore—but I won’t cover the book linearly.

Now let's meet the four big shots driving this Southern drama:

<ul>
  <li>
1. Scarlett O'Hara:
	Scarlett O'Hara marries three times in the novel and gives birth to three children (with three baby daddies).
	Spends most of the book claiming to love Ashley Wilkes. She is also the protagonist in the story-- and an opportunist.
	Scarlett is 16 at the beginning of the novel and 28 when it finishes.
 </li>

<li>
2. Melanie Wilkes:
	Scarlett's #1 fan: both wife and cousin to Ashley Wilkes. She is often dismissed as naive or a dimwit; others 
	defend her as the elegant strategist. Melanie is two years older than Scarlett.
 </li>

 
<li>
3. Rhett Butler:
	Scam artist. His line at the end of the book is, “My dear, I don’t give a damn” -- not ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn", as 
	the movie portrays. Another opportunist. Rhett is about thirty-five when he is introduced in the novel and forty-seven at the end.
</li>

<li>
4. Ashley Wilkes:\\
	The dreamer; married to Melanie Wilkes. Ashley is in his early thirties at the start of the book and in his forties by the end.
 </li>
</ul>

There are several other characters in the novel that drive the survival, gumption, and superiority themes. We will
cover most of them shortly. However, let's get some rules out of the way with respect to this blog - rules that you can expect me
to follow:

1. The blog will be in reverse chronological order - older posts will appear lower down in the feed.

2. I will not go back and edit old posts - even for spelling: my mistakes will be forever immortalized - is that art or self-torture?

3. I will make a new, "modified" post if and when I feel that an earlier post no longer accurately reflects how characters and the storyline interact.

4. Lastly, I will update the blog weekly, starting today (07/31/2025).
