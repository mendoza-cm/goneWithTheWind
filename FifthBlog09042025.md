This week is another detour—individuals who deserve their own narratives in the story let alone an entire 
book dedicated to their perspective in all this, will be the focus. Quick note: I’m working on a comments 
section (the link is at the top near the Table of Contents). It should be live soon—aiming for next week at the latest.

All opinions are welcome no matter how irrelevant they may seem to appear—I hope they tie into the story line (or my own take), 
but if they unravel, no hard feelings—things fall apart last second for me all the time. Sometimes I catch it and sometimes I press 
Enter; it's usually a good time either way. 

We left off with Mammy in the last detour, and there’s still more to say about her. As I noted, Mitchell seamlessly integrates the 
invaluable labor of Black characters while maintaining the illusion that they contribute little more than children, sometimes even 
as helpless as them. A striking example appears in Chapter 3, describing Ellen O’Hara’s grace and efficiency as Tara’s mistress:


>*She would have been a strikingly beautiful woman had there been any glow in her eyes, any responsive warmth in her smile 
or any spontaneity in her voice that fell with gentle melody on the ears of her family and her servants . . . .It was a 
voice never raised in command to a servant or reproof to a child but a voice that was obeyed instantly at Tara, where her 
husband's blustering and roaring were quietly disregarded.*


There is a lot to be said about Ellen and I do not mean to take anything away from such a strong and beautiful woman, but her 
description contains in its reflection a very real image of the truths of slavery, suggesting that respect and gentle treatment, 
rather than abuse, elicited obedience. A sharp contrast to what comes next: "Scarlett could not imagine her mother's hand without 
her gold thimble or her rustling figure unaccompanied by the small negro girl whose sole function in life was to remove basting 
threads and carry the rosewood sewing box from room to room." Mitchell includes this passage as if it showcases Ellen's elegance, 
but it feels like rubbing salt in an opened wound: the dehumanization of a young girl reduced to a prop for some lady's virtue. 
It's a brutal reminder of the dispensability of a slave—they were nice things in nice people's houses and at the same time the entire foundation
beneath it.

Mammy's world navigates through this fabricated reality: it has given her her identity and without it, her position is ill-defined. Mitchell makes 
this hierarchy explicit in Chapter 3 when describing Tom Slattery:

>*The house negroes of the Country considered themselves superior to white trash, and their unconcealed scorn stung him [Tom Slattery], while their more
>secure positions in life stirred his envy. By contrast with his own miserable existence, they were well-fed, well-clothed and looked after in sickness
>and old-age. They were proud of the good names of their owners and, for the most part, proud to belong to people who were quality . . .*


This passage reveals a dual hierarchy: one among the enslaved—house slaves like Mammy and Uncle Peter hold a higher status than field hands, and the other—tying 
a slave's status to the *quality* of their owners. And what was *quality* exactly? In practice, it appeared to mean how superfluous your owner could afford to be. 
The Wilkes at Twelve Oaks could devote entire days to entertainments—barbecues that rolled into formal dances—while the enslaved managed every detail behind the scenes.

The  internal hierarchy among the enslaved mirrors the white social order—the O’Haras’ status elevates their slaves above those of “lesser” White families, like the 
Slatterys. Yet they are on the same footing as the Wilkes' slaves, as Pork's marriage to Dilcey signifies. Or perhaps I am making this all up; I haven't actually 
researched it, but it seems to make sense to me.

Uncle Peter, Pork, Dilcey, and even Prissy are bound by the same hierarchy that Mammy lives by. They, too, do not deviate from their well established roles after the war—they 
are not encouraged to either. There are some exceptions of course, like when Scarlett tries to get everyone to pick cotton. Their refusal to pick cotton, met with bewilderment, 
shows the old hierarchy’s stubborn grip—fainting would’ve been less scandalous than stooping to field work. Uncle Peter's loyalty to Aunt Pittypat never falters, although he is 
not asked to pick cotton.


Pork has been with the O'Hara family since Gerald first won Tara in a card game; being Tara's valet, he came with the house. Mitchell describes him as the head house servant, 
taking advantage of Gerald's inability to manage the staff and eventually advising Gerald to marry—and marry “a wife whut has got plen’y of house nigg***." And even if he will not 
pick cotton, Pork isn't above risking his life for the O'Haras. After the war, he is shot while out late at night attempting to steal food for everyone. Desperate and hurt, he awakens Scarlett who tends to his wound—she 
is moved by his loyalty and promises him a gold watch when she gets some money again. What else could she offer? And what else could Pork expect? Pork tries to retrieve more information, 
asking when she thinks she might get said money: he's hoping for a life-line—a glimpse of the return of the old and familiar hierarchy. Pork’s hope for the watch shows his clinging 
to the old hierarchy’s promises—it's all he knows and it's better than uncertainty.

Pork differs from Mammy in that he has a family—other than the O'Hara's, that is. His wife Dilcey is from the Wilkes' plantation, brought over in the beginning of the novel along with her daughter, 
Prissy. Dilcey personally thanks Mr. O'Hara for purchasing Prissy, along with her, to the point of embarrassing Gerald. She is described as having better speech than most slaves, less slurred and 
more accurate. Dilcey is also part Native American and, “walked with a dignity that surpassed even Mammy's, for Mammy had acquired her dignity and Dilcey's was in her blood.” 

Dilcey’s no stranger to Tara’s hierarchy, but her role cuts deeper when the war hits. In Chapter 24, Scarlett and Melanie stumble back from Atlanta’s burning ruins with Prissy, Wade, and Melanie’s 
newborn, Beau in tow—Beau is starving for milk. Pork, without hesitation, offers up his wife, Dilcey, to nurse Beau. He knows her loyalty runs as deep as his; plus, it is sort of her job.

This detour only scratches the surface of the stories of Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, and others—each deserving their own spotlight. As the war upends Tara’s hierarchies, their identities, tethered to the 
O’Haras, face an uncertain future. We’ll revisit Prissy, Uncle Peter, and others later, perhaps tying their experiences to the shifting world of the novel or even reflecting on how these dynamics 
echo in more recent events. For now, their labor and loyalty remain the unspoken foundation of Tara’s story.

So just to quickly reiterate, the comment link is up but not working yet—I’ll set it properly soon, so please wait until 09/06/2025 before trying it out. I really look forward to reading your thoughts. 
Mine are usually a mess, but when someone throws a tire iron into them, it makes me pause and reflect; so have at it. I can be nice—I promise I won’t bite (too hard).
