Chapter 32 ends with Scarlett's mind made up: she will go to Atlanta and throw herself at Rhett Butler if she has to, in exchange for Tara. No cost is too great—she will accept either marriage or prostitution. Melanie, as always, is portrayed as clueless, 
and Ashley cannot help but admire Scarlett's gallantry. Mammy, of course, is not only helping with the dress that Scarlett is making in an attempt to deceive Rhett out of his money, but will escort her to Atlanta.

Chapter 33 opens with Scarlett and Mammy’s arrival in Atlanta. Scarlett, not having notified Aunt Pittypat in advance, immediately seeks a carriage to avoid walking. Almost half of the chapter is devoted to Scarlett’s hope of finding a familiar face to 
offer a ride, while Mammy vigilantly guards her reputation—there are strict social rules about entering carriages, paid or not, and Mammy's no fool; she'll make sure Scarlett's name is not tarnished. Scarlett complies with Mammy’s guidance, as Mitchell 
writes, “. . . she wished no disagreement with Mammy,” but this obedience borders on farce.

Mammy’s servitude, like Uncle Peter’s, isn’t just personal loyalty—it’s a remnant of a system that strips them of choice, even in a “freed” South. Scarlett, caught in her own desperate struggle, holds power over Mammy. Scarlett may be ruthless, but Rhett 
Butler's complicity runs deeper: her defiance is born of constraint, his indifference of privilege. And that privilege isn't just Rhett's. In Atlanta, it coats the air—Aunt Pittypat lives off it, Uncle Peter and Mammy enforce it, and Scarlett bends it to 
her survival.

Arriving at Aunt Pittypat's, Scarlett sees uncle Peter and exclaims, “Run get Auntie's swoon bottle, Peter! It's really me!” Scarlett is safe, she can relax; Uncle Peter and Mammy will ensure everything is in order. Aunt Pittypat, meanwhile, is a mirror of 
Scarlett's obliviousness to privilege. Encouraged by Scarlett—who doesn't want to directly ask where Rhett is, or whether he will be invited to dinner so she can make her offer—Aunt Pitty rambles about the families in Atlanta. One by one, she lists their 
troubles, gossips about them and pities her own situation. She complains that Uncle Henry is stingy with her allowance, and she doesn't understand why ladies cannot just stay single like she did if men can no longer meet gentlemanly standards of appearance 
and vanity. Yet her home is not even her own; Scarlett and Melanie have just as much right to it. Then, there's Uncle Peter—like Mammy, he's the loyal servant with no autonomy.

Scarlett insists her plans are to sleep all day, leaving Mammy to trail Pittypat on errands. Mammy's needs vanish behind Aunt Pittypat's comfort—a given in the South. Very convenient for Scarlett. Mammy would never condone her plan to bargain with Rhett; her loyalty 
to propriety clashing with Scarlett’s survival instincts.

With Mammy distracted and Melanie back at Tara, Scarlett’s path is clear—no one stands in her way. Melanie may not appear in Chapter 33, but her absence reverberates through the previous two chapters—where she's sidelined just as neatly. Scarlett kisses Ashley, Melanie's 
husband, after learning about the taxes and then schemes to secure Rhett’s money and Melanie’s only role throughout all this is a joking remark when the curtains are being made into a dress, implying Scarlett would never stoop to Rhett. Mitchell regularly notes 
that Will and Mammy possess a knack for knowing what’s afoot without being told. If Melanie lacks this gift, she has another: an uncanny ability to lighten the burdens of those around her, easing their guilt with her carefully crafted ignorance at just the 
right moments. 

Melanie's no Scarlett—thank goodness—but if she can navigate Southern society, she can handle Scarlett—she's a big girl. Melanie’s ability to use silence for survival is a powerful tool, but Scarlett is constantly stomping on it with her own hustle. Scarlett
is always center stage. During Melanie’s
childbirth, we hear more about Scarlett’s discomfort—the pain from Melanie gripping her hand too tight, the noises, her regret at not learning from the matrons—than Melanie’s whole ordeal of giving birth without help. Melanie suffers in silence; Scarlett 
makes sure everyone knows when she’s uncomfortable.  

Melanie stays unusually quiet when Rhett hauls them out of Atlanta and on the road to Tara after he bails. She cleans up after Scarlett’s Yankee shooting with a smile, and jumps in to pick cotton when Mammy and Pork drag their feet. Does she know about 
Scarlett kissing Ashley or Scarlett's pursuit of him? Perhaps; perhaps not. But her silence, like Mammy’s and Peter’s unseen labor, props up Scarlett’s desperate hustle in a world where power thrives on quiet sacrifices. Melanie’s a team player
and sometimes leading means staying in the back.
