# Gone With the Wind Creative Analysis (In Progress)

This project explores the characters of *Gone With the Wind* through a modern lens—examining survival, power, gender, and societal expectations.

## 🔍 What to Expect

- In-depth character analyses: Scarlet, Melanie, Rhett, and others
- Short satirical ad scripts (e.g., “Obey Your Thirst” Sprite series)
- A tone that balances pop culture, literary critique, and humor

## 🚧 Status: Under Construction

New posts will be added weekly. Early drafts will live here as I refine them—feel free to follow along or offer feedback!

## 💡 Why This Project?

To combine my interest in narrative analysis, pop culture, and writing with my data storytelling skills. Also, to showcase range for a potential career transition into copywriting or editorial strategy.
