# Gone With the Wind Creative Analysis (In Progress)

This project explores the characters of *Gone With the Wind* through a modern lens‚Äîexamining survival, power, gender, and societal expectations.

## üîç What to Expect

- In-depth character analyses: Scarlett, Melanie, Rhett, and others
- Short satirical ad scripts (e.g., ‚ÄúObey Your Thirst‚Äù Sprite series)
- A tone that balances pop culture, literary critique, and humor

## üöß Status: Under Construction

New posts will be added weekly. Early drafts will live here as I refine them‚Äîfeel free to follow along or offer feedback!

## üí° Why This Project?

To combine my interest in narrative analysis, pop culture, and writing with my data storytelling skills. Also, to showcase range for a potential career transition into copywriting or editorial strategy.

## Chapter 32: Behind the Scenes
This is a *Behind-the-Scenes* view of the different directions Chapter 32 yanked me while organizing the blog ([read the blog here](https://mendoza-cm.github.io/GWTW/myBlog.html)) for the 14th of August.
It was an overwhelming swamp of pride, survival, and entitlement--a literary Pandemonium. 

Chapter 32‚Äîthe novel‚Äôs halfway mark‚Äîthrows us into Tara‚Äôs fragile reality. The war is over, and among the thirteen occupants of Tara, Ellen is not one of them. Gerald's mind is broken, Suellen is engaged to Frank Kennedy, and Carreen grieves Stuart Tarleton. Scarlett keeps Tara running and everyone fed with the help of Will Benteen, but also with Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy‚Äîthe freed slaves whose labor and loyalty form the estate's real backbone, though neither Mitchell nor Scarlett ever truly acknowledge it. Meanwhile, taxes are closing in: Scarlett must find a way to raise three hundred dollars to keep Tara from being taken.

I could have started with that for my Chapter 32 blog: the survival theme is obvious. But pride and entitlement slap just as hard‚Äîbuilt on the labor of those Mitchell romanticizes or ignores. In Chapter 3, Mitchell writes that Gerald‚Äôs slaves took "shameless advantage" of his "loud bark and no bite," with Pork advising, "whut you need is a wife, and a wife whut has got plen‚Äôy of house nigg***." This framing paints the slaves as cunning and almost privileged (and yes; I did censor that word because I hate it). It's projection‚ÄîMitchell reflecting the masters' own anxieties onto the slaves. The idea that the slaves *had it made* is meant to erase the brutal reality and cast freedom as a burden.

So where to start was not exactly so black and white. Lack of material was not the issue for my tardiness with respect to Thursday's blog. I didn't even post it until 2:30 AM on Friday, but since it was prior to me going to bed, I am referring to it as Thursday's blog. I will continue this practice for all future blogs.

Moving on. The delay came from grappling with Scarlett's flaws: I did not like Katie Scarlett during my first read-through, which is what I think really prompted this second reading‚Äîthat and finally acknowledging how young she was. I thought joining a book club would encourage discussion, understanding, and growth.

That did not happen‚Äîa major reason being: I just don't like people. Nothing about them personally, they just take so much energy from me: I need to eat and sleep twice as much when I am around them; I become irritable and very mean. So in everyone's best interest, I stay home often. However, upon my second read, I began to see Scarlett as a young, vibrant, courageous and wonderfully selfish woman. I highly doubt her vivacity would have shined through quite as bright had she not been forced to take matters into her own hands with respect to 12 lives‚Äîthat is, had the war not occurred.

Furthermore, my appreciation of Melanie‚Äîwho Scarlett finds it hard to give any credit to‚Äîhas greatly expanded; she is almost completely absent in Chapter 32; Melanie is the one, however, who quietly shoulders the weight of survival. When Scarlett kills the Yankee soldier in Chapter 26, Melanie‚Äîfrail, barely able to stand‚Äîstill grabs a sword from the wall, ready to defend their home. And afterward, she helps Scarlett clean up the mess without the slightest hint of judgement. No hesitation. No need for the spotlight. She doesn't ask for opportunities, nor does she take advantage when they arise. And yet, she endures.

The war, Ellen's death, and the killing of the Yankee soldier tested Scarlett. But the Slattery incident pushed her over the edge‚Äîit was the straw that broke everything‚Äîthis was my reason for focusing on it within the last blog, but there are many more delicate nuances to explore with the Slattery's and Scarlett's world‚Äîa world riddled with class contradictions.

Will Benteen sits only slightly above the Slatterys‚Äîif that means anything: he may still be considered a "Cracker," but at least he owned two slaves prior to the war. That's one of Mammy's main concerns with the Slatterys‚Äîthem not having enough money to even own slaves: even the house slaves of Tara are more respectable than the Slatterys‚Äîthey can expect to be taken care of in their old age (Chapter 3).
So besides the freed slaves whose loyalty binds them to Tara and whose struggles Mitchell so conveniently throws aside, there were many avenues to explore: Will Benteen's status and acceptance into the O'Hara household, or even Ashley's dignity, honor, and strengths‚Äîor lack thereof; Melanie‚Äîthe silent hero.

Scarlett may dominate Chapter 32, but the backbone of Tara‚Äîand the novel‚Äîis in the hands of the people Mitchell pushes aside. They‚Äôre the thread I‚Äôm pulling on next.

Note: This *Behind the Scenes* entry leans into a more stream-of-consciousness style. It's deliberately less polished, more raw‚Äîa way to capture the chaos of themes and impressions this chapter unleashes. My regular blogs will remain tighter, but these digressions are an attempt to show the undercurrents that don't always fit neatly into structure, especially when it comes to entitlement and survival‚Äîthis is the search for clarity inside the confusion.
