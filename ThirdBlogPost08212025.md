If you are continuing after having just read last week's blog: Scarlett does make it to Atlanta with Mammy, but as mentioned in the *Behind-the-Scenes* of my README found here [View README](https://github.com/mendoza-cm/goneWithTheWind/blob/main/README.md), 
this week's blog takes a detour.  

Margaret Mitchell left few details in Gone With the Wind with respect to the private lives of the non-White occupants of Tara. I am far from the first to have noticed this—although Mitchell's 
clever ommissions parallel how society sidelined them: no coincidence—likely second nature to her. However, I am going to use what she did provide: the sporadic commentary and epic insights 
sprinkled throughout the novel to poke around into the lives of a few of the individuals that Mitchell so easily overlooks. So for just a moment, a few of real behind-the-scenes participants get to be in the spotlight.

Mammy is the most obvious first choice: her history is more entwined with the O'Hara family than any other non-White occupant of Tara. Raised by Ellen's mother before becoming Ellen's 
own mammy, she appears throughout the novel more often than others in her position—but unlike Will Benteen, she never receives a backstory. (She doesn't get a real name either.)

Mammy keeps the O’Hara household running with military precision, unafraid to scold Gerald, Ellen, or the children if they break her rules. Though fiercely protective of Scarlett, she is also her 
most unflinching critic, knowing better than anyone the dangerous mix of charm and selfishness in the girl she raised. Her authority in the household is unquestioned, though it is built on a 
foundation she did not choose. Even after emancipation, Mammy remains at Tara—her sense of loyalty and identity tied not to freedom, but to the O'Haras themselves—or maybe the thought of starting 
over again at her age was just too much. In reality, where would she go; all she knew were the O'Haras.

Mammy makes her first appearance in Chapter 2 after the Tarleton twins depart: 
> Mammy emerged from the hall, a huge old woman with the small, shrewd eyes of an elephant. She was shining black, pure African, devoted to her last drop of blood to the O'Haras, Ellen's mainstay, the despair of her three daughters, the terror of the other house servants. Mammy was black, but her code of conduct and her sense of pride were as high as or higher than those of her owners. —Chapter Two, *Gone With the Wind*

Mitchell gives us glimpses like this—striking, memorable, but still flat: no fizz. When Ellen returns from Baptizing the Slattery baby, Mammy's first concern is Ellen—she preps her a plate and presses 
her to eat. Mammy casually dismisses the Slatterys with cutting words, "folks dat did dey be wuth shootin' dey'd have nigg*** ter wait on dem." Mammy is Ellen's shadow and always defined by her commentary 
on others. She's definitely not a 'pick me' girl.

In Chapter 32, Mammy is right there again—helping Scarlett cut up the green velvet curtains and stitch them into a gown—Mammy might not know exactly what Scarlett's scheming or how she plans on 
"borrowing" money, but Mammy sure as hell isn't going to let Scarlett go to Atlanta alone. Ironically, Scarlett tries to dissuade her through flattery, "Mammy you're so sweet to 
want to go with me, but how on earth would the folks here get on without you? You know you just about run Tara." Mammy isn't amused; she won't fight Scarlett anymore—Mammy steps aside and lets her lead.

Mammy deserves more ink, but she's left her mark. Next week: the chaos of Chapter 33. Then, we’ll take another **Detour** to finish what Mammy started—pulling Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy, 
out of the margins and onto center stage.
