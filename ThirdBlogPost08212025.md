If you are continuing after having just read last week's blog: Scarlett does make it to Atlanta with Mammy, but as mentioned in the *Behind-the-Scenes* of my README found here([View README](https://github.com/mendoza-cm/goneWithTheWind/blob/main/README.md)), 
this week's blog is taking a slight detour.  

Margaret Mitchell left few details in Gone With the Wind with respect to the private lives of the non-White occupants of Tara. I am far from the first to have noticed this—although Mitchell 
is very clever in how she includes these marginalized characters. Shelving these individuals parallels how society treated them: no coincidence—likely coming naturally for her. I am going to 
use what she did provide: the sporadic commentary and epic insights sprinkled throughout the novel to poke around into the lives of a few of the individuals that Mitchell so easily sidelines. 
So for just a moment, a few of real behind-the-scenes participants get to be in the spotlight.

Mammy is the most obvious first choice: her history is more entwined with the O'Hara family than any other non-White occupant of Tara. Raised by Ellen's mother before becoming Ellen's 
own mammy, she appears throughout the novel more often than others in her position—but unlike Will Benteen, she never receives a backstory.

Mammy keeps the O’Hara household running with military precision, unafraid to scold Gerald, Ellen, or the children if they break her rules. Though fiercely protective of Scarlett, she is also her 
most unflinching critic, knowing better than anyone the dangerous mix of charm and selfishness in the girl she raised. Her authority in the household is unquestioned, though it is built on a 
foundation she did not choose. Even after emancipation, Mammy remains at Tara—her sense of loyalty and identity tied not to freedom, but to the O'Haras themselves—or maybe the thought of starting 
over again at her age was just too much. In reality, where would she go; all she knew were the O'Haras.

Mammy makes her first appearance in Chapter 2 after the Tarleton twins depart: 
"Mammy emerged from the hall, a huge old woman with the small, shrewed eyes of an elephant. She was shining black, pure African, devoted to her last drop of blood to the O'Haras, Ellen's mainstay, 
the despair of her three daughters, the terror of the other house servants. Mammy was black, but her code of conduct and her sense of pride were as high as or higher than those of her owners." 
—Chapter Two, Gone With the Wind

Mitchell gives us glimpses like this—striking, memorable, but still flat: no fizz. When Ellen returns from Baptizing the Slattery baby, Mammy's first concern is Ellen—she preps her a plate and presses 
her to eat. Mammy casually dismisses the Slatterys with cutting words, "folks dat did dey be wuth shootin' dey'd have nigg*** ter wait on dem." Mammy is Ellen's shadow and always defined by her commentary 
on others. She's definitely not a 'pick me' girl.

In Chapter 32, Mammy is right there again—helping Scarlett cut up the green velvet curtains and stitch them into a gown—Mammy might not know exactly what Scarlett's scheming how she plans on 
"borrowing" money, but Mammy sure as hell isn't going to let Scarlett go by herself to Atlanta. Slightly ironic, Scarlett tries to deter Mammy from going through flattery, stating, "Mammy you're so sweet to 
want to go with me, but how on earth would the folks here get on without you? You know you just about run Tara." Mammy calls bullshit. 

I want to spend more time on Mammy, but need to end the blog early. Next week we will continue with Chapter 33, but then take another *Detour* the following week to finish discussing Mammy before moving on 
to Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy: the *other* Tara family.
