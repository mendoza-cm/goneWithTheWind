Scarlett O’Hara married her first husband, Charles Hamilton, at sixteen—purely out of spite. She was young, headstrong, and convinced
she loved his cousin, Ashley Wilkes. After cornering Ashley in what she thought was an empty library at the Wilkes family barbecue—and
being politely rejected—she comes face-to-face with Rhett Butler. Not exactly a meet-and-greet: Rhett had been there the entire time she was
confessing her love, demanding Ashley choose her. He heard her make a fool of herself, heard Ashley turn her down, and enjoyed every
humiliating moment. He knew she was no more a lady than he was a gentleman—and he wasn’t shy about making sure she, too, knew.
So began their saga.

Gerald had warned her—like should marry like if a marriage is to survive. Naturally, she ignored him. And the instant it backfired,
Rhett enters. Rhett matches her appetite for life—and he's only twice her age,
too. Scarlett's class, education, and charm had men dangling like ripe fruit, ready to fall if she so much as glanced
their way. Rhett, with his male privilege—money and whiteness—had the bankroll and connections to buy his way out of anything. Both knew
how to work a room, bend a rule, and make the outcome look like fate. But that kind of hustle only works if the table’s already tilted in
your favor. Mammy or Pork couldn’t dream of scheming; not without being branded “uppity”— a death sentence in the South. Rhett and Scarlett could
take the same risks, and call it strategy.

In Chapter 32, Scarlett clutches Tara’s red clay as she walks up the front steps, desperate. She has just learned (Chapter 31) that 
taxes could take the plantation from her. She finds Ashley alone in the shed, and when he can’t offer a plan to save Tara, she throws 
herself at him, begging him to take her away. He tells her she’s only tired, but she collapses into his arms, crying. Then—magic. 
They share a kiss “for a timeless time,” his lips taking hers hungrily, as if he could never have enough. But he stops it from going 
further: he blames himself and vows to leave with Melanie and the baby. Ashley presses red clay from Tara into her 
hands, reminding her the land is still hers. She promises to never throw herself at him again—so, he need not leave. As he watches her walk away, he is convinced she’ll keep her word.

If Tara is going to be saved, Scarlett's the one to do it. The men were out of the running: Gerald’s spirit was 
broken, Ashley’s dreams were useless, and Will Benteen could manage the place but little else—unless she wanted to hand him Carreen. Melanie? 
Please. Even the freed slaves had more chance than she did. No, it would be up to Scarlett. With her mind already made up,
Jonas Wilkerson and Emmie Slattery—recently hitched—stroll up to Tara in a fancy new carriage.

If you don’t recognize Emmie—neither did Scarlett. She recognized Jonas with his newfound confidence as a member of the Freedmen's Bureau, but
she couldn’t get past the flashy attire the woman with him was wearing: her skirt—hoops obviously were not so wide this year, jackets shorter,
and her hat! And then it hits her—she knows this woman—and of course, Scarlett pulls a Scarlett—she's mad and everyone is going to know about
it. Emmie Slattery, from her no-slave-owning, "po' white" family, strutting up to Tara. Money or no, she's not welcome.

This scene works better if the Slatterys haven’t faded from memory. They were introduced in Chapter 3 and barely mentioned since. Their low
status kept most Southerners from associating with them. Jonas Wilkerson, the O’Hara overseer in Chapter 2, and a Yankee, may not have been
able to marry Emmie Slattery prior to the war, but that didn't stop him from making regular visits to see her. His options for a wife were slim,
but his association with the Slatterys gained him no favors with the neighbors. Even Mammy bad-mouthed Emmie (Chapter 24), and the book—through
Scarlett’s eyes—called her “nasty” (Chapter 25): *If it hadn’t been for that nasty Emmie, who’d had a bastard brat by their overseer—Ellen
wouldn’t have died.* Scarlett holds her solely responsible.

Jonas somehow landed on his feet after the war—befriending freed slaves and coming into money. Whether honest or not was anybody’s guess.
And in Chapter 32, we learn Emmie's fate, or rather her luck: she's got her heart set on Tara. Gerald built Tara on a gambler’s lucky hand—everything from
the land to the slaves who worked it, won after fleeing Ireland for killing a man. Now Jonas and Emmie were riding their own streak, hoping Yankee luck could
plant them where O'Hara luck had once reigned. But if Scarlett had anything to say about it, their winning hand was about to fold.
She understood completely why they had come. Just the thought of Emmie Slattery where
her mother Ellen once stood was unbearable. She must act—do anything to stop it. She will not lose Tara to such people. Her ambitions are
questionable, but her determination is absolute: she wants what she wants, and everyone else can go to hell. She'll even tarnish Ellen's good
name to fight dirty—letting Emmie believe Ellen's charity was just pity.

**About the lateness:**<br>
I know, I know—I said in my first blog this would be weekly. That was a lie. My anxiety got the better of me, and all the themes got a
little too overwhelming. Chapter 32 marks a turning point in the novel—Scarlett is transforming, pushing her limits, testing what she’s willing
to do—and it pushed my limits too. I’ll post more on my method and how I eventually processed this chapter in the README on my project site
(update coming in a few days: [View README](README.MD)
). I’m still getting used to writing again; shaking all the rust free. I will aim to keep my weekly deadline and in the future
will post about late blogs on my README file in the link above.

For the record, this is a re-read. I first read Gone With the Wind two years ago and wanted to join a book club for my second read—a definite
must. The story’s rich with history, passion, and uncomfortable truths. But apparently, I was delusional with my thinking and forgot to consider my 
natural inclination to stay away from people—I'm sure the drinking and smoking doesn't help. So, email me at mendozachristina1729@gmail.com if you want to share your thoughts. I’d
like to add a comment section eventually and this way, I can keep the bad habits with the option of adding a few more.

In short — I bit off more than I could chew, but the gristle's tasty—mighty savory. So, the newlyweds take off and Scarlett starts scheming. Tara is her life; 
she’d burn it down before handing it over. Her mind flies frantically — who has money? Someone must. Rhett Butler.

The last time she saw Rhett, he kissed her like a man possessed, told her he loved her, and then promptly abandoned her just outside Atlanta — 
leaving her with Melanie, Melanie's newborn, her own son Wade, and Prissy — while he went off to secure his return to the South. That’s right: 
Rhett Butler, the blockade-running king of opportunists, joined the Confederate army in its last gasps. It was a perfect move: his name would 
be cleared, his fortune kept, and his face welcome again—as long as he avoided any last-minute heroics. Quite outside his character, so no real 
threat there. Scarlett had sworn she hated him, but now here he was—her only play. 

And in this gamble, Mammy becomes both chaperone and co-conspirator. Mammy knows exactly what Scarlett’s planning, hates every bit of it, 
but she won’t let her go alone. If Tara is to be saved, she’ll keep Scarlett in line—or at least alive—long enough to see it through. 
So she helps Scarlett tear down the green parlor drapes and together they make a gown for the big 
performance. Suellen lends her Irish-lace collar, Carreen her shoes. Ashley could only sit in admiration. 

Next stop: Atlanta—where Scarlett will wager everything on the one man who could save her, or ruin her completely.
